/** \page howto_writeinstaller Writing an extension installer
Opticks extension installers use the AEB file format.
AEB files are zip files with a specific structure as detailed in the above link.
The metadata for an AEB is specified in AEBL, and RDF grammar represented in XML.
An easier way to specify RDF is in the notation3 format which can be converted to XML using the raptor package available in the %Opticks dependencies distribution.
This howto will present a sample extension and explain how to convert the notation3 metadata and installer files into an AEB.

\section writeinstaller_filestructure Setting up the file structure.
The first step is to create a directory for the AEB.
This sample AEB will provide an extension icon, an end user license agreement, a splash screen, a default settings file, some end user help, and a plug-in module.
 - SampleAeb
   - content
     - DefaultSettings
       - 60-Sample.cfg
     - Help
       - Sample
         - index.html
         - tutorial.html
   - platform
     - win32-x86-msvc8.1-release
       - PlugIns
         - Sample.dll
     - win64-x86-msvc8.1-release
       - PlugIns
         - Sample.dll
     - solaris-sparc-studio12-release
       - PlugIns
         - Sample.so
   - splashScreen
     - SampleSplash.jpg
   - icon
     - sample.png
   - license
     - LGPL.html
   - install.rdf

The \c content and  \c platform subdirectories contain all the content that will be installed into the %Opticks directory structure.
\c content contains platform independent files and \c platform contains a subdirectory for each supported platform.
The \c splashScreen, \c icon, and \c license subdirectories contain metdata files.
Finally, the \c install.rdf file contains the extension metadata.
The notation3 source code is placed in \c install.n3 and the rapper.exe utility is used to convert this to \c install.rdf.
\code

The first few lines setup some XML namespaces used by the AEBL metadata format and begin the metadata block.
The extension name, version, description, homepage, and creator are strictly for display purposes and are defined near the beginning of the metadata.
The \c aebl:type field is usually 2 indicating a general extension.
The only other value relevant to %Opticks is 32 indicating a collection of extensions.
Collections are beyond the scope of this tutorial and are discussed in the AEBL document.
The \c aebl:id field uniquely identifies this extension and should either look like an email address (it does not need to be a real address) or it should be a bracketed UUID.

The icon URL and license URL point to files in the AEB zip file.
They are both optional and there can be multiple license URLs specified.
The icon is displayed in the %Opticks extension manager dialog and the licenses are displayed to the user when an extension is installed.
The \c opticks:splashScreenURL field is similar to the icon and license URLs and identifies an image which will be displayed to the user when %Opticks is starting.
The splash screen does not replace the standard splash screen and all installed extension splash screen will be displayed during startup.

The \c aebl:targetApplication block indicates the version of %Opticks this extension targets.
The id will always be opticks@ballforge.net for official versions of %Opticks.
See the %Opticks ballforge website for an up-to-date list of released versions.
The \c aebl:targetPlatform entries identify which platforms this extension supports.

Finally, the \c opticks:helpEntry block add an entry to the help menu in %Opticks which points to a file or directory in the AEB zip file.

The notation3 file can be converted to an XML file using the rapper tool.
If you are using the %Opticks dependencies build of the rapper tool on Windows, you may need to add Dependencies/expat/bin/win32 to your path so that rapper.exe can locate libexpat.dll.
\code
rapper -g -o rdfxml-abbrev install.n3 > install.rdf
\endcode
Once this file has been generated, create a zip file containing the entire directory structure.
Do not include the top level directory so the install.rdf file, content directory, etc. are at the top level position in the zip file.
The zip file should be renamed so that it has the \c .aeb file extension.
The AEB is now ready to install in %Opticks.
If you would like to test an AEB without generating a zip file, you can point the %Opticks extension installer directly to the install.rdf file.

That's all that is needed to create an extension but there are other features supported including automatic dependency checking between %Opticks extensions.
See \subpage opticks_specific_aebl for more information.

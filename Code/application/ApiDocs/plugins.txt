/** \page writing_plugin Writing a plug-in class

\section plugin_subclass Create Plug-In Class
In order to create a plug-in, you must first decide which plug-in interface you would like to implement.
The available plug-in types and sub-types are:
 - PlugIn
	- Option
	- Properties
	- Executable
		- Georeference
		- Importer
		- InterpreterManager
		- RasterPager
		- Exporter
		
You can directly subclass one of those interfaces and implement all of the abstract functions in order to create a plug-in.
However, it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you subclass one of our Shell classes.
These Shell classes implement large portions of these interfaces for you and require you write less code.
A complete list of Shell classes is shown below:
 - PlugInShell
	- OptionShell
		- OptionQWidgetWrapper
	- PropertiesShell
		- PropertiesQWidgetWrapper
	- ExecutableShell
		- AlgorithmShell
			- AlgorithmPlugIn
		- DockWindowShell
		- ExporterShell
		- GeoreferenceShell
		- ImporterShell
			- RasterElementImporterShell
				- HdfImporterShell
					- Hdf4ImporterShell
					- Hdf5ImporterShell
		- InterpreterManagerShell
		- RasterPagerShell
			- CachedPager
		- ViewerShell
		- WizardShell

\section using_services Accessing Opticks Services
While writing your plug-in you will need access to the rest of the plug-in API.
The way that you access the rest of the plug-in API is to use our Services.
The complete list of our Services is:
- DesktopServices <sup>1</sup>
	- SessionExplorer <sup>1</sup>
- ModelServices
- ApplicationServices
	- SessionManager
	- ConfigurationSettings
	- ObjectFactory
	- DataVariantFactory
- UtilityServices
	- MessageLog
- AnimationServices
- PlugInManagerServices

<sup>1</sup> - DesktopServices and SessionExplorer are only available when ApplicationServices::isBatch() returns false.

The easiest method to access these Services is to use the Service template specialization, so
\code
#include "ConfigurationSettings.h"
#include <string>

void foo()
{
	std::string version = Service<ConfigurationSettings>()->getVersion(); //Fetch the application version # from the ConfigurationSettings Service.

	//OR, another way to do the above

	Service<ConfigurationSettings> pConfSett;
	std::string version = pConfSett->getVersion(); 

	//OR, yet another way to do the above
		
	ConfigurationSettings* pConfPointer = pConfSett.get();
	version = pConfPointer->getVersion();
}
\endcode

There is a Service template specialization for each of the Services mentioned above.
The Service classes can be used anywhere inside your plug-in library (i.e. .dll, .so).

Now that you have created a plug-in subclass, you need to register it with the application.
Please read \ref register_plugin for more details.

/** \page register_plugin Registering your plug-in
%Opticks discovers your plug-ins by loading your plug-in library and then querying for any registered plug-ins.
If you haven't created a plug-in subclass to register, please read \ref plugin_subclass .
Once you have a plug-in subclass to register, you will first need to prepare your plug-in library (i.e. .dll, .so) by registering a module inside your library.

In order to register a module inside your library, it is recommended that you create a new .cpp file called ModuleManager.cpp.
Inside this ModuleManager.cpp, you should use the REGISTER_MODULE macro.
Below, you will see the ModuleManager.cpp that is included with the Tutorial plug-in library.
\include Tutorial/ModuleManager.cpp

The REGISTER_MODULE macro has one argument, which is the module id.
This module id must be a valid C++ identifier and must not be used elsewhere in your plug-in library.
The module id will be used to declare a C++ namespace inside your plug-in library and must therefore be unique.
In addition, this module id must be unique for all other plug-in libraries that might be loaded by the application.
If two plug-in libraries have the same module id, only the first will be loaded by the application.
In addition, you must only use the REGISTER_MODULE macro once in your plug-in library.
Attempting to use it twice inside a single plug-in library will cause compile and link errors.

Now that your plug-in library has a registered module, you can actually register your individual plug-in subclasses.

You can use one of two macros to register your individual plug-in subclasses.
You can use either REGISTER_PLUGIN or REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC, see below for examples.
\code
REGISTER_PLUGIN(OpticksTutorial, Tutorial1);
\endcode
or
\code
REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC(OpticksTutorial, Tutorial1, Tutorial1);
\endcode
The first argument to either macro is the module id that was used in the REGISTER_MODULE() macro.
The last argument to either macro is the constructor of your plug-in subclass.
The REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC macro uses it second argument to uniquely identify the plug-in within the module.
If your plug-in subclass is not templated and has a no-argument constructor, you can simply use the REGISTER_PLUGIN macro which will deduce the plug-in identifier from the plug-ins classname.
If however, your plug-in subclass requires constructor arguments or is templated, you should instead use REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC and provide a unique identifier for plug-in as the second argument to the macro.
The plug-in identifier provided must be a valid C++ identifier and needs only to be unique within the context of the module.
Please see below for a more complete example.
\code
//assume there are two plug-in subclasses, that would constructed as follows:
// PlugIn* pPlugIn1 = new TestPlugIn();
// PlugIn* pPlugIn2 = new TestPlugIn2<int>(true);
//see below for the plug-in registration code:
REGISTER_MODULE(TestModule);

REGISTER_PLUGIN(TestModule, TestPlugIn); //one could also use the commented out line below
//REGISTER_PLUGIN(TestModule, TestPlugIn, TestPlugIn);

//REGISTER_PLUGIN(TestModule, TestPlugIn2<int>(true)); // this will NOT compile, instead use the line below
REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC(TestModule, TestPlugIn2, TestPlugIn2<int>(true));
\endcode

When using REGISTER_MODULE, REGISTER_PLUGIN and REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC, it's important to know that they can be put into any .cpp file that will included in your plug-in library (.dll, .so).
This allows a developer to put the REGISTER_PLUGIN-* macro in the .cpp that is providing the implementation for that plug-in subclass.
This completes the discussion on standard plug-in registration.
If you'd like to learn more about a very advanced type of plug-in registration, you can continue reading the next section.

\section advanced_plugin_register Advanced Plug-In Registration
The above documentation has described how to do static (i.e. compile-time) plug-in registration.
It is also possible to perform plug-in registration during %Opticks start-up the first time that %Opticks loads a plug-in library (.dll, .so).
This is known as dynamic plug-in registration.
It is possible to mix both static and dynamic plug-in registration together in a single module.

In order to perform dynamic plug-in registration, you must first create a subclass of the DynamicPlugInFactory base class.
It is this class that will perform all of the dynamic plug-in registration.
You must then use the REGISTER_DYNAMIC_MODULE macro instead of the REGISTER_MODULE macro.
Please keep in mind that you can still only use one use of this macro per plug-in library (.dll, .so).
The REGISTER_DYNAMIC_MODULE macro has a second argument that must be the name of the DynamicPlugInFactory subclass you have created.
See below for an example.
\include PlugInSampler\ModuleManager.cpp
The source code above comes from the PlugInSampler.
You can read \ref plugintutorial_building for information on building and running the above code.
It is also suggested you read the documentation for DynamicPlugInFactory.

/** \page runningplugins Running your plug-ins
This document will describe the options available to you when running your newly written plug-ins with %Opticks.
Two approaches to configuring %Opticks to run your plug-ins will be presented.
Following that is a more detailed section that describes all the necessary configuration for running %Opticks.
It is highly recommended that you read this entire document before deciding which approach is most appropriate for you.

\section running_approach1 Approach 1: Use an Opticks installation
This approach involves copying your plug-ins into an existing %Opticks installation.
The installers only provide a release mode build of %Opticks.
On Windows, you must use either the 32-bit or 64-bit install of %Opticks, depending on whether you are building 32-bit or 64-bit plug-ins.
On Solaris, we only provide a 64-bit binary.
Also on Solaris, there is no distiction between debug and release, so you put either compilation type of your plug-in into a Solaris installation of %Opticks.
In order to use this approach on either Windows or Solaris, you need to perform the following steps:
 -# Copy your compiled plug-in (i.e. .dll or .so) into the PlugIns folder of the %Opticks installation.
 -# Copy any third party dependency libraries (i.e. .dll or .so's that are not plug-ins) into the Bin folder of the installation.
 -# Copy any custom settings default files (i.e. *.cfg, see ConfigurationSettings) into the DefaultSettings folder of the installation.
 -# Copy any plug-in on-line help into the Help folder of the installation.
 -# Copy any product templates into the Templates folder of the installation.
 -# Copy any wizard files into either the Wizards folder of the installation or the SupportFiles/Wizards folder of the installation.
 -# Copy any other custom supporting data files into the SupportFiles folder of the installation.
 -# On Windows, if you wished to run your plug-ins in debug mode, you would need to perform the following additional steps:
   -# Rename the existing Bin folder in the installation to Bin-release
   -# Rename the existing PlugIns folder in the installation to PlugIns-release
   -# Create a new Bin folder in the installation by copying either the SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-Win32-Debug\\Bin or SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-x64-Debug\\Bin folder depending on whether you are trying to run 32-bit or 64-bit plug-ins respectively.
   -# Create a new PlugIns folder in the installation by copying either the SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-Win32-Debug\\PlugIns or SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-x64-Debug\\PlugIns folder depending on whether you are trying to run 32-bit or 64-bit plug-ins respectively.
   -# Copy your compiled plug-in (i.e. .dll or .so) into the PlugIns folder that you just created in the installation folder.
   -# Copy any third party dependency libraries (i.e. .dll or .so's that are not plug-ins) into the Bin that you just created in the installation folder.
   -# At this point, you could run your plug-ins in debug mode.
      If you wished to revert back to running in release mode, you would have to reverse the above steps.
      Also, note that with this approach you cannot run debug mode and release mode simultaneously.
    
\section running_approach2 Approach 2: Create a custom workspace
This approach involves creating a custom workspace. 
You will need to perform the following steps:
 -# Create a new folder anywhere on the filesystem.
    This directory will be called WS_HOME from this point forward.
 -# Copy the DefaultSettings, Help, SupportFiles, Templates folders from an %Opticks installation into the WS_HOME folder.
 -# Create a UserSettings folder in the WS_HOME folder.
 -# Create a Build folder in the WS_HOME folder.
 -# On Windows, perform the following steps:
    -# If you will run plug-ins in release 32-bit mode, then copy the Bin and PlugIns folder from SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-Win32-Release into WS_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-Win32-Release folder.
    -# If you will run plug-ins in debug 32-bit mode, then copy the Bin and PlugIns folder from the SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-Win32-Debug into WS_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-Win32-Debug folder.
    -# If you will run plug-ins in release 64-bit mode, then copy the Bin and PlugIns folder from the SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-x64-Release into WS_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-x64-Release folder.
    -# If you will run plug-ins in debug 64-bit mode, then copy the Bin and PlugIns folder from the SDK_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-x64-Debug into WS_HOME\\Build\\Binaries-x64-Debug folder.
 -# On Solaris, perform the following steps:
	-# Copy the Bin and PlugIns folder from an %Opticks installation into the WS_HOME/Build/Binaries-solaris-sparc-release folder.
 -# For both Windows and Solaris, perform the following steps:
    -# Create a opticks.dep file (it must be named exactly this) in all the Bin folders you have created thus far in the WS_HOME/Build/Binaries-* folders with the content shown below.
    \verbatim
    !depV1
    deployment:
		UserConfigPath: ../../UserSettings
		AppHomePath: ../..
    \endverbatim
    For more details on the opticks.dep file, please see \ref deploymentfiles .

Once you have created this workspace, you would copy any custom plug-ins into the appropriate PlugIns folder.
The advantage of this approach is that this workspace is entirely self-contained.
This means that you can follow this procedure as many times as you wish on a single computer even using the same version of %Opticks and each WS_HOME you create will not interfere with any WS_HOME you've created on the same machine.
This approach also has the advantage that you can easily switch between debug and release on Windows.
All you need to do is run the Opticks.exe in the appropriate Build\\Binaries-* folder, no other configuration is necessary to switch back and forth.

\section running_notes Additional notes about running Opticks
In general, when running %Opticks there are two classes of things that %Opticks requires to run properly.
%Opticks requires:
 -# %Executable code
 -# Other supporting data
 -# User settings

The "Executable Code" consists of:
 -# The %Opticks and OpticksBatch executable.
 -# %Opticks plug-ins.
 -# Third-party dependency libraries.
 
The first and third items should reside in the same folder, for an %Opticks installation this is the Bin folder.
The plug-ins need to all reside in a single folder, for an %Opticks installation this is the PlugIns folder.
The location of the %PlugIn folder is controlled by the "PlugInPath" setting in the deployment file.
You can read \ref deploymentfiles to determine the default location %Opticks searches for plug-ins if a deployment file is not present along with documentation on how to provide a custom deployment file.

The "Other supporting data" consists of:
 -# DefaultSettings
 -# Help
 -# Templates
 -# SupportFiles
 
The DefaultSettings and Help must always be located in the folder specified by the "AppHomePath" setting in the deployment file.
You can read \ref deploymentfiles to determine the default location %Optick uses for the "AppHomePath" along with ways to change that path.

The Templates and SupportFiles are controlled by ConfigurationSettings.
Specifically ProductView::getSettingTemplatePath(), ProductView::setSettingTemplatePath(), ConfigurationSettings::getSettingSupportFilesPath(), ConfigurationSettings::setSettingSupportFilesPath().
This means that each individual user that runs %Opticks can have a custom SupportFiles and Template path just for their user account.
By default, this does not occur.
In a traditional installation, the SupportFiles defaults to AppHomePath/SupportFiles and Templates defaults to AppHomePath/Templates.
If the user wants to change the paths, they can use "Tools\Options..." in the application.

The "User Settings" consist of a .cfg file that is saved to the disk during application shutdown.
This file contains all of the setting values in ConfigurationSettings that have been overridden by the user, see ConfigurationSettings::isUserSetting(), ConfigurationSettings::setSetting() for more details.
This file is saved to the folder specified by the "UserConfigPath" setting in the deployment file.
You can read \ref deploymentfiles to determine the default location %Opticks uses for "UserConfigPath" along with ways to change that path.
The user setting file is named according the following convention, "UserSettings-[version]-[operating system]-[arch][mode].cfg"
In practice this means that all %Opticks installations on the same machine that use the same "UserConfigPath" that have the  same arch (e.g. 32-bit, 64-bit) and mode (e.g. debug, release) will share one user settings file.
This can cause confusion and the solution to this problem is to use a deployment file to specify a different value for the "UserConfigPath" for the problematic installations.

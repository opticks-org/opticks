\section opticks_aebl_section Opticks implementation details
Extension IDs are not case sensitive and will be converted to lower case values when installing in %Opticks.
In addition to the standard AEBL verbs, %Opticks defined the following verbs in the \c urn:2008:03:opticks-aebl-extension-ns# namespace.
 - splashScreenURL - This is an \c aeb:// URL identifying an image to use as an extension splash screen. This is an optional verb.
 - helpEntry - This block describes an entry in the %Opticks help menu. There may be zero or more \c helpEntry verbs.
   - name - This describes the name of the help entry. This name will appear in the help menu.
   - url - This describes a URL which will be displayed when the help entry is selected. This is usually an \c aeb:// URL but may be an \c http:// or \c https:// URL.
   
Platform strings are defined as: os-procarch-compiler-debugmode
Valid values are:
 - os: win32 (no longer supported in Opticks 5.x), win64, solaris (no longer supported in Opticks 4.10.x), linux, unknown
 - procarch: x86, sparc, x86_64, unknown
 - compiler: msvc8.1, msvc10.0, studio11, studio12, gcc4, unknown
 - debugmode: debug, release

Combinations currently recognized in %Opticks are:
 - win64-x86-msvc10.0-debug
 - win64-x86-msvc10.0-release
 - linux-x86_x64-gcc4-debug
 - linux-x86_x64-gcc4-release
 
The following are paths allowed in the "content" portion of an AEB.
 - Bin - 3rd party dll's, misc executables, and Qt plug-ins
 - PlugIns - plug-in modules
 - DefaultSettings - .cfg overrides, sub-directories are not allowed, only files with extension .cfg
 - Doc - misc documentation
 - Help - help files, top-level files are not allowed, only sub-directories
 - Templates - product templates, no sub-directories allowed
 - SupportFiles - misc support files
 - Wizards - wizard files: This will install wizards in the user's configurable wizard directory which is, by default, the %Opticks temp directory. If you need to install wizards which will always be visible to all users, place them in the SupportFiles/Wizards directory.

Icon files can be in any format supported by Qt's QImage.
The default supported formats are: bmp, gif, jpg, mng, png, pbm, pgm, ppm, tiff, xbm, and xpm.

License files can be either plain text or Qt richtext which is a subset of HTML.
License files ending in ".htm" or ".html" are assumed to be richtext and all other license files are assumed to be plain text.

AEB files may be placed in the $APP_HOME/Extensions/AutoInstall directory.
Files in this directory will be automatically installed when %Opticks is started.
If this method is used, the user will not be prompted to accept license agreements.
Only AEB files will be installed from this directory, not unpacked AEB archives.

Files installed via an AEB should not be modified during execution.
During the life cycle of an extension install, it is assumed that all installed files remain identical to the files in the original AEB.

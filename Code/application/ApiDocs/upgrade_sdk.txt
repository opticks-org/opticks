\subsubsection u430_to_431_deps_Qt Qt
Qt has been upgraded from 4.5.0 to 4.5.2.
You are NOT required to upgrade your plug-in to use Qt 4.5.2, you can continue to use Qt 4.5.0.
It is recommended however, to upgrade to Qt 4.5.2.
You can find additional details on the Qt change on the qtsoftware.com site, see http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/changes for more details.
This upgrade was done because a plug-in developer requested we upgrade to a version of Qt that included the ActiveQt component in the LGPL licensed version of Qt.
You should upgrade our "https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/255/Qt-4.5.0-opensource.zip" to "https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/301/Qt-4.5.2-opensource.zip".
See \ref dependencies for more details on getting the updated Qt dependency.

\subsubsection u430_to_431_deps_gdal gdal
gdal is now being built as a shared library on Solaris.
Previously, it was being built as a static library.
This change was made to correct a problem with importing JPEG files on Solaris.
You should upgrade from our "https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/194/gdal-1.5.zip" to "https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/300/gdal-1.5-so.zip".
See \ref dependencies for more details on getting the updated gdal dependency.

\subsection u431_module_caching New Module and Plug-In Caching
<HR>
%Opticks 4.3.1 provides a new module caching mechanism designed to improve application start-up time.
If a module declares that it can be cached, then %Opticks will not load the module (.so, .dll) or construct any of the plug-ins in the module during start-up unless the module contains plug-ins that are configured to be executed at start-up (see Executable::isExecutedOnStartup).
More precisely, %Opticks will load the module one start-up (.so, .dll) and will store the details in a cache file.
On subsequent starts, it will compare the module (.so, .dll) size and last modified date/time against the values it has stored in the cache and if the module has not changed, it will read all of the required information directly from the cache instead of loading the module (.dll, .so) and querying plug-in instances.
%Any module built using an earlier SDK than 4.3.1rc1 will never be eligible for caching, this was done to maintain functional compatibility.
If a module is re-built against the 4.3.1rc1 SDK, it will automatically be cached if the REGISTER_MODULE macro was used.
If it was using the REGISTER_DYNAMIC_MODULE macro or legacy registration method (see \ref u425_to_430_newmodule "4.3.0 Module Loading Mechanism") it will not be eligible for caching.
If a developer wishes to use the REGISTER_MODULE macro, but does not want their module to be cached, they can replace the REGISTER_MODULE macro with the new REGISTER_NON_CACHED_MODULE macro.
The arguments to both macro's are identical.

\subsection u425_to_430_deps Dependencies
<HR>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_deps_Qt Qt
Qt has been upgraded from 4.3.4 to 4.5.0.
If you are using Qt in your plug-in, you must upgrade your plug-in from Qt 4.3.4 to Qt 4.5.0 in order to properly work with %Opticks 4.3.0 and later.
You can find additional details on the Qt change on the qtsoftware.com site, see http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/changes for more details.
This upgrade was done so that plug-in developers now have the option of using either the GPL, commercial or LGPL licensed version of Qt.
The LGPL license option is a new option that was made available to developers with the 4.5.0 release.
Please read http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/faqs/licensing?hotspoturl=None for more details.
%Opticks has been switched to exclusively use the LGPL licensed version of Qt.
This means that you can now use "dependencies.py" to fetch a binary build of Qt for all the platforms that %Opticks is supported on.
See \ref dependencies for more details.

\subsubsection u425_to_430_deps_ossim ossim
ossim has been updated in a binary breaking manner.
The ossim that is used by %Opticks includes %Opticks specific patches.
You should upgrade from our "https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/240/ossim-10682-Mar03-2009.zip" to "https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/279/ossim-10682-May13-2009.zip".
ossim was updated in order to better support the import/export of NITF files.
See \ref dependencies for more details on getting the updated ossim dependency.

\subsubsection u425_to_430_deps_Hdf4 Hdf4
Hdf4 has been upgraded from 4.2r1 to 4.2r3.
If you are using HdfPlugInLib or Hdf4 in your plug-in, you must upgrade your plug-in from Hdf4 4.2r1 to Hdf4 4.2r3.
The Hdf4 library was upgraded so that %Opticks could support Hdf4 on Windows 64-bit, previously only Windows 32-bit and Solaris SPARC 64-bit were supported in %Opticks.
If you are using the Visual Studio property sheets provided in the SDK, you will need to use the new "hdf4-debug.vsprops" and "hdf4-release.vsprops" as appropriate instead of using "hdf4.vsprops".
See \ref dependencies for more details on getting the updated Hdf4 dependency.
<br><br><br><br>

\subsection u425_to_430_newmodule Module Loading Mechanism
<HR>
%Opticks 4.3.0 provides a new module loading mechanism.
The module loading mechanism refers to how %Opticks loads plug-in libraries (.dll, .so) and locates the individual plug-in subclasses located within the library (.dll, .so).
In order to minimize plug-in developer disruptions, %Opticks 4.3.0 simultaneously supports the new module loading mechanism (4.3.%X and later) and the legacy module loading mechanism (4.2.%X and earlier).
For details on the new loading mechanism, please read \ref register_plugin.

The legacy loading mechanism (4.2.%X and earlier) will be supported throughout the 4.3.%X line of %Opticks development, but is considered deprecated and will be removed in a future release (no earlier than 4.4.%X).
It is highly encouraged that plug-in developers take 4.3.0 as the opportunity to update their modules and plug-ins to use the new module loading mechanism.
The reason that the new module loading mechanism was developed is because the legacy loading mechanism could not be made to work on other platforms (e.g. Linux).
In addition, the new loading mechanism is more compact for plug-in developers to write and provides additional flexibility to plug-in developers.

Even though %Opticks supports the legacy module loading mechanism, you will need to make a change before your plug-in will properly compile and link against 4.3.0 if you wish to continue using the legacy module loading mechanism.
In order to continue using the old mechanism, you will need to define the preprocessor symbol of DEPRECATED_MODULE_TYPE.
You can do this any number of ways.
You can add a "#define DEPRECATED_MODULE_TYPE" before any '\#include "ModuleManager.h"'.
You can also add the preprocessor symbol definition to compiler (Visual Studio, Sun Studio) invocation line.

If you are using the Visual Studio property sheets provided in the SDK, you will need to add "DeprecatedPlugInSettings.vsprops" to your project.
This property sheet defines DEPRECATED_MODULE_TYPE and also ensures the "PlugInModule.DEF" file is used when linking your plug-in DLL.

It should also be noted that any plug-in libraries (e.g. .dll, .so) using the legacy module loading mechanism that are loaded by %Opticks will appear in the "Plug-Ins" tab of the "Session Explorer" dock window with blue text.
Plug-in libraries that are using the new module loading mechanism will appear in black text.

\subsection u425_to_430_compiler Compiler
<HR>
On Solaris, we are now requiring plug-in developers to compile plug-ins using "Sun Studio 12" instead of "Sun Studio 11". The upgrade of the "Sun Studio" is available from Sun Microsystems free of charge. The compiler upgrade was done because there were compatibility problems compiling Qt 4.5.0 with Sun Studio 11 that were resolved by upgrading the compiler to Sun Studio 12. The entire %Opticks source code base was upgraded to the new compiler without requiring any source code changes. This compiler change causes AEBs to need a target platform of "solaris-sparc-studio12-debug" and "solaris-sparc-studio12-release" instead of "solaris-sparc-studio11-debug" and "solaris-sparc-studio11-release".

\subsection u425_to_430_breaking API
<HR>
\subsubsection u425_to_430_allplugins All Plug-Ins
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
%Opticks has been changed to determine its production status based upon the production status of its plug-ins.
If a release candidate version of %Opticks is run, then it will always consider itself, "not for production", and will display the appropriate banners on the top and bottom of every image.
Previously, if a final version of %Opticks (e.g. 4.2.2, 4.2.3) was run, it will always consider itself, "production", and <b>NEVER</b> display the "not for production" banners on the top and bottom of images.
With %Opticks 4.3.0, any final version of %Opticks (e.g. 4.2.2, 4.2.3) will now query all plug-ins and call PlugIn::isProduction().
If any plug-in in the application returns false from PlugIn::isProduction(), then the entire application will consider itself, "not for production", and will display the "not for production" banners on the top and bottom of every image.

<b>Procedure:</b>
To determine if your plug-in is returning false from PlugIn::isProduction(), you can start up %Opticks and then go to the "Plug-Ins" tab of the "Session Explorer" dock window.
If you "right-click" in the bottom of the "Plug-Ins" tab and select "Expand All", any plug-ins that have their name rendered in "red" have returned false from PlugIn::isProduction().
In order to change the return value, you should call PlugInShell::setProductionStatus(bool value) in the constructor of your plug-in subclass.
Calling PlugInShell::setProductionStatus(true) will cause your plug-in to return true from PlugIn::isProduction() and calling PlugInShell::setProductionStatus(false) will cause your plug-in to return false from PlugIn::isProduction().
If you do not specifically call setProductionStatus() in the constructor of your plug-in subclass, it will default to false.
</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_AlgorithPattern AlgorithmPattern
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The mergePseudocolorResults() function has been removed and has not been replaced.

</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_AnyData AnyData, AnyDataExt1
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The AnyDataExt1 class was removed.
The two virtual functions on AnyDataExt1, serialize() and deserialize() have been moved onto the AnyData class and made non-virtual.
The arguments have stayed the same.

<b>Procedure:</b>
- If you have any classes that are subclassing both AnyData and AnyDataExt1, you can remove the AnyDataExt1 from your inheritance line.
  No other changes are required.
- Existing subclasses of AnyData but not AnyDataExt1 do NOT need to be changed in any way.

</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_BYTE_ORDER BYTE_ORDER
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The \#define BYTE_ORDER was renamed to \#define OPTICKS_BYTE_ORDER.

<b>Procedure:</b>
If you were relying on the %Opticks version of BYTE_ORDER, please change your code to use OPTICKS_BYTE_ORDER.
</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_Classification Classification::isValid()
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The signature of Classification::isValid() was changed.
Previously the errorMessage argument could be omitted because a default argument value was defined.
The default argument value for the errorMessage parameter was removed.
This was because the code was improperly following the C++ standard by providing a default argument value for a non-const reference argument.
%Any code relying on the default argument value, must now provide an explicit value for the errorMessage argument before calling Classification::isValid().

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
Classification* pClassification;
bool isValid = pClassification->isValid();
\endcode
must be changed to:
\code
std::string errorMessage;
bool isValid = pClassification->isValid(errorMessage);
\endcode
</div>

</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_ImportExport ConfigurationSettings - "FileLocations/ImportExportPath"
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The "FileLocations/ImportExportPath" setting has been fully removed.
This setting was removed during %Opticks 4.2.%X, but a shim was left in to maintain functional/binary compatibility during %Opticks 4.2.%X.
For %Opticks 4.3.%X, this shim has been removed.
%Any attempts to get the value for the "FileLocations/ImportExportPath" will result in invalid data being returned.

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
DataVariant dv = Service<ConfigurationSettings>()->getSetting("FileLocations/ImportExportPath");
const Filename* pFilename = dv_cast<Filename>(&dv);
\endcode
must be changed to either:
\code
const Filename* pFilename = ConfigurationSettings::getSettingImportPath();

</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_DynamicModule DynamicModule
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The signature for the load() and getProcedureAddress() functions have changed.
These functions previously took arguments of type "const char*" and now take arguments of type "const std::string&".

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
DynamicModule* pDynModule;
pDynModule->load(NULL);
pDynModule->getProcedureAddress(NULL);
\endcode
must be changed to:
\code
pDynModule->load("");
pDynModule->getProcedureAddress(string());

\subsubsection u425_to_430_EncodingType EncodingType - UNKNOWN
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The UNKNOWN value for the EncodingType enumeration was removed.
It has <b>NOT</b> been replaced.
It was removed because it conflicted with code in the HDF4 library.
In addition, now that the application is using EnumWrapper, it was no longer needed.

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
EncodingType defaultValue = UNKNOWN;
if (/* some condition */) defaultValue = INT1SBYTE;
if (defaultValue == UNKNOWN) /* do something */
\endcode
must be changed to:

if (defaultValue.isValid() == false) /* do something */
\endcode
</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_EndianType EndianType - BIG_ENDIAN, LITTLE_ENDIAN
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The BIG_ENDIAN and LITTLE_ENDIAN enum values of the EndianType enumeration have been renamed.
They were renamed to avoid conflicts with system defines provided by certain compilers.

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
EndianType temp = BIG_ENDIAN;
EndianType temp2 = LITTLE_ENDIAN;
\endcode
must be changed to:
\code
EndianType temp = BIG_ENDIAN_ORDER;
EndianType temp2 = LITTLE_ENDIAN_ORDER;
\endcode
</div>

\subsubsection u425_to_430_MenuIcon Executable, ExecutableShell - MenuIcon.
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The Executable::getMenuIcon(), ExecutableShell::getMenuIcon() and ExecutableShell::setMenuIcon() was removed.
It you were using any of these functions to provide a menu icon for your executable plug-in, you must now provide an implementation of SessionItem::getIcon() in your plug-in subclass.

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
static const char* sMyXpm[] = /* Assume this is XPM content */;
class MyExecutable : public ExecutableShell

The canExtrapolate() function was removed.
It has been replaced by adding an additional argument to the pixelToGeo(), pixelToGeoQuick(), geoToPixel() and geoToPixelQuick() functions.
The additional argument is optional, so any existing code that calls those four functions does not need to be changed.

<b>Procedure:</b>

The following code:
\code
Georeference* pTemp;
bool extrapolate = dynamic_cast<GeoreferenceExt1*>(pTemp)->canExtrapolate();
\endcode
must be changed to:
\code

\subsubsection u425_to_430_ImpResAndAgent ImporterResource and ImportAgent
<div style="margin-left: 3em">
<b>Description:</b>
The ability to import multiple files at a time instead of a single file was added to ImporterResource and ImportAgent for 4.3.0.
This change resulted in the following:
- Two changed constructors for ImporterResource (this includes two changed instantiate functions for ImportAgent).
- setImportDescriptors() was replaced with setDatasets(), see the specific section for more details.
- Removal of showOptionsDialog() and isOptionsDialogShown(), see the specific section for more details.
- Addition of new functions and constructors, see ImporterResource and ImportAgent for complete documentation.

<b>Procedure:</b>
Two of the constructors for ImporterResource have changed, see below for upgrade procedures.

The following code:
\code
std::vector<ImportDescriptor*> descriptors; //assume this was populated elsewhere
ImporterResource res2("Auto Importer", descriptors, NULL, true);
\endcode
must be changed to:
\code
std::map<std::string, std::vector<ImportDescriptor*> > descriptors; //the key of the map is the filename, for each filename is a list of the datasets located in the file.

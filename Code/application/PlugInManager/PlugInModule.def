; This file defines the entry points into the WIN32 Plug-In DLL. 
; EACH PLUG-IN MUST INCLUDE THIS FILE WITH ITS VISUAL C++ PROJECT OR 
; THE EXPORTED DLL ENTRY POINTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE AND THE PLUG-IN 
; WILL NOT WORK.  This file is necessary because the entry points are 
; included in the libplugin.lib static library, and the DLL does not
; have enough visibility within the static library.

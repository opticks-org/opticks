 * Dynamic extension of class attributes
 *
 * Dynamic Object refers to a class that allows attributes to be 
 * added during runtime.  Many classes extend the Dynamic Object
 * to provide future support for new attributes without changing
 * the class specification.
 *
 * This subclass of Subject will notify upon the following conditions:
 * - The following methods are called: setAttribute(), setAttributeByPath(),
 *   adoptAttribute(), adoptAttributeByPath(), merge(), removeAttribute(),
 *   removeAttributeByPath(), clear().
 * - %Any of the objects within the DynamicObject post a notification.
 *   These notifications will be passed on to any observers of the
 *   DynamicObject
 * - Everything else documented in Subject.
